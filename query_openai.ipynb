    "rules = \"\"\"The following rules provide a robust, step-by-step protocol for identifying emergent, unassimilated English lexical borrowings (anglicisms) in Spanish text.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial Identification\n",
    "- Determine if the word or multiword expression is of English origin or mimics English word formation.\n",
    "  - If the word is not of English origin, do not consider it an anglicism.\n",
    "  - If it mimics English formation but does not exist in English (pseudoanglicism, e.g., balconing), consider it an anglicism.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exclusion of Proper Names and Code-Mixed Inclusions\n",
    "- If the word is a proper noun (person, organization, product, location, event, etc.) or a direct code-mixed quotation, do not consider it an anglicism.\n",
    "- Borrowings embedded within proper nouns or named entities do not count, unless the proper noun is part of a multiword borrowing used grammatically as in English (e.g., Google cooking is annotated).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Graphophonological Compliance\n",
    "- If the word’s spelling and pronunciation conform to Spanish graphophonological rules (e.g., bar, club), proceed to dictionary checks.\n",
    "- If not (e.g., show, look), generally consider it an anglicism unless it is a long-registered realia word (see Rule 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Adaptation and Assimilation Status\n",
    "- If the word has been morphologically or orthographically adapted to Spanish (e.g., fútbol, tuit, líder), do not consider it an anglicism.\n",
    "- If the word remains unadapted, continue to dictionary checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Dictionary Verification\n",
    "- If the unadapted word is registered in the Diccionario de la Lengua Española (DLE):\n",
    "  - If it appears in italics, consider it an anglicism.\n",
    "  - If it appears without italics and with the relevant meaning, do not consider it an anglicism (it is considered assimilated).\n",
    "  - If it is not registered or not with the relevant meaning, consider it an anglicism.\n",
    "- For multi-sense words (e.g., top), only consider them an anglicism when used with unregistered meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Realia and Long-Registered Borrowings\n",
    "- If the word is a long-registered realia borrowing (cultural terms like jazz, pizza, whisky, club), do not consider it an anglicism, even if unadapted.\n",
    "- If the word is a recent or emergent realia borrowing not yet registered, consider it an anglicism.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Multiword Borrowings\n",
    "- Do consider multiword expressions borrowed as a unit from English (e.g., reality show, best seller).\n",
    "- For adjacent borrowings not forming a fixed English phrase (e.g., look sporty), select each word separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Exclusions and Special Cases\n",
    "- Do not consider an anglicism:\n",
    "  - Latinisms, scientific units, species names, acronyms (unless part of a multiword borrowing), or digits in isolation.\n",
    "  - Metalinguistic usages, literal quotations, or code-switched expressions not integrated into the sentence.\n",
    "  - Names of peoples or languages, and words derived transparently from proper nouns (e.g., un iPhone, un whatsapp).\n",
    "- Do consider an anglicism:\n",
    "  - Pseudoanglicisms (Spanish-coined words mimicking English, e.g., footing, balconing).\n",
    "  - Unadapted names of fictitious creatures (e.g., hobbit, troll).\n",
    "  - Borrowings embedded in compounds or prefixed forms, if the borrowed element retains independence (e.g., ex influencer, nano influencers).\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "extra_help = \"\"\"Examples of words that are NOT anglicisms include:\n",
    "- Words fully adapted to Spanish orthography (e.g., 'fútbol', 'líder', 'tuit')\n",
    "- Long-established borrowings (e.g., 'bar', 'club', 'jazz', 'whisky')\n",
    "- Proper names of people, places, or companies (e.g., 'Twitter' as a company name)\n",
    "- Scientific terminology with Latin or Greek roots\n",
    "\n",
    "Special rules for digital media and technology:\n",
    "1. Names of online platforms (e.g., 'Facebook', 'Twitter') are NOT anglicisms when used as proper nouns to refer to the specific company or service.\n",
    "2. However, these names ARE anglicisms when used generically (e.g., \"Hizo un twitter\" to mean \"He made a tweet\").\n",
    "3. Generic terms related to digital culture ARE anglicisms when they maintain English form (e.g., 'post', 'blog', 'meme', 'podcast', 'streaming').\n",
    "4. Terms for social media actions in their English form ARE anglicisms (e.g., 'like', 'share', 'tweet').\n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-word expressions:\n",
    "1. Analyze whether the entire expression functions as a unified borrowing from English.\n",
    "2. Examples of multi-word anglicisms: 'fast food', 'big data', 'home office', 'fake news'.\n",
    "3. Do NOT count individual English words that appear adjacent to each other but do not form a standard expression in English.\n",
    "4. When in doubt about whether multiple words form a single anglicism, consider them separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "For business, finance, and technical terminology:\n",
    "1. Recent business terms that maintain English spelling ARE anglicisms (e.g., 'CEO', 'manager', 'marketing', 'branding', 'broker').\n",
    "2. Technical computing terms that maintain English spelling ARE anglicisms (e.g., 'hardware', 'software', 'online', 'web').\n",
    "3. Industry-specific English jargon ARE anglicisms (e.g., 'blockchain', 'big data', 'know-how').\n",
    "4. International brand names and trademarks are NOT anglicisms unless used generically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this step-by-step process for identifying anglicisms:\n",
    "1. First, identify all words and phrases that appear to have English origin.\n",
    "2. For each candidate term, apply the exclusion criteria (proper names, adapted words, etc.).\n",
    "3. For remaining terms, verify they maintain English spelling/pronunciation patterns.\n",
    "4. Group related words that form a single expression in English.\n",
    "5. Verify each term against the specific rules for digital media, business terms, etc.\"\"\"\n"
