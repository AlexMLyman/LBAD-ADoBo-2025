The following rules provide a robust, step-by-step protocol for identifying emergent, unassimilated English lexical borrowings (anglicisms) in Spanish text.

1. Initial Identification
- Determine if the word or multiword expression is of English origin or mimics English word formation.
  - If the word is not of English origin, do not consider it an anglicism.
  - If it mimics English formation but does not exist in English (pseudoanglicism, e.g., balconing), consider it an anglicism.

2. Exclusion of Proper Names and Code-Mixed Inclusions
- If the word is a proper noun (person, organization, product, location, event, etc.) or a direct code-mixed quotation, do not consider it an anglicism.
- Borrowings embedded within proper nouns or named entities do not count, unless the proper noun is part of a multiword borrowing used grammatically as in English (e.g., Google cooking is annotated).

3. Graphophonological Compliance
- If the word’s spelling and pronunciation conform to Spanish graphophonological rules (e.g., bar, club), proceed to dictionary checks.
- If not (e.g., show, look), generally consider it an anglicism unless it is a long-registered realia word (see Rule 5).

4. Adaptation and Assimilation Status
- If the word has been morphologically or orthographically adapted to Spanish (e.g., fútbol, tuit, líder), do not consider it an anglicism.
- If the word remains unadapted, continue to dictionary checks.

5. Dictionary Verification
- If the unadapted word is registered in the Diccionario de la Lengua Española (DLE):
  - If it appears in italics, consider it an anglicism.
  - If it appears without italics and with the relevant meaning, do not consider it an anglicism (it is considered assimilated).
  - If it is not registered or not with the relevant meaning, consider it an anglicism.
- For multi-sense words (e.g., top), only consider them an anglicism when used with unregistered meanings.

6. Realia and Long-Registered Borrowings
- If the word is a long-registered realia borrowing (cultural terms like jazz, pizza, whisky, club), do not consider it an anglicism, even if unadapted.
- If the word is a recent or emergent realia borrowing not yet registered, consider it an anglicism.

7. Multiword Borrowings
- Do consider multiword expressions borrowed as a unit from English (e.g., reality show, best seller).
- For adjacent borrowings not forming a fixed English phrase (e.g., look sporty), select each word separately.

8. Exclusions and Special Cases
- Do not consider an anglicism:
  - Latinisms, scientific units, species names, acronyms (unless part of a multiword borrowing), or digits in isolation.
  - Metalinguistic usages, literal quotations, or code-switched expressions not integrated into the sentence.
  - Names of peoples or languages, and words derived transparently from proper nouns (e.g., un iPhone, un whatsapp).
- Do consider an anglicism:
  - Pseudoanglicisms (Spanish-coined words mimicking English, e.g., footing, balconing).
  - Unadapted names of fictitious creatures (e.g., hobbit, troll).
  - Borrowings embedded in compounds or prefixed forms, if the borrowed element retains independence (e.g., ex influencer, nano influencers).
